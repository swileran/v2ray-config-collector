Overview
This project is a robust, end-to-end workflow for V2Ray configurations. It collects configs from multiple sources, normalizes them, validates their syntax, and tests their connectivity. It supports common V2Ray protocols like VMess, VLess, and socks-based proxies. It is designed to run on a workstation, a server, or inside a container. The design emphasizes reliability, extensibility, and clear visibility into each step of the process.

Why this tool matters
- Proxies come from many sources. A single tool to fetch, unify, and verify reduces manual work.
- Valid configurations save time and reduce failed connection attempts.
- Automated testing helps ensure that a proxy is usable before you rely on it in production.
- Multi-threading lets the tool scale with a growing set of sources and tests without blocking.

Core concepts
- Fetch: pull configurations from multiple sources. Sources may include HTTP(S) endpoints, local files, cloud storage, or remote repositories.
- Normalize: convert incoming configurations into a consistent internal representation.
- Validate: check syntax, required fields, and protocol compatibility.
- Test: attempt a real connectivity check against test endpoints to prove the proxy works.
- Persist: store results in structured formats for reporting and auditing.
- Report: generate human-friendly and machine-friendly outputs for dashboards and CI.

Features
- Multi-source collection: pull from diverse sources in parallel.
- Protocol coverage: VMess, VLess, Shadowsocks variants (SS/SSR), and other common V2Ray flavors are recognized.
- Validation rules: ensure required fields exist, values are in the allowed ranges, and the configuration is parseable.
- Connectivity tests: perform tests to verify reachability and basic performance metrics.
- Concurrency: use multi-threading to speed up data collection and testing.
- Output formats: export results as JSON, CSV, and human-readable tables.
- Reproducible workflows: generate reproducible artifacts for audits and compliance.
- Extensibility: plug in new data sources and test mechanisms with minimal changes.
- Observability: structured logs and optional metrics to help diagnose issues.
- Lightweight and portable: works on Linux, macOS, and Windows with Python.

Architecture
- Fetcher layer: modules that know how to retrieve data from different sources.
- Normalizer: converts diverse formats into a unified internal model.
- Validator: rule engine that checks the integrity and compatibility of each configuration.
- Tester: connectivity module that attempts to establish a session through a proxy.
- Orchestrator: controls the lifecycle of fetch, process, validate, test, and report steps.
- Storage: simple in-memory storage with optional file-based backups for persistence.
- CLI: command-line interface for interactive use and automation.

Getting started
You can set up this project on a developer workstation or a CI environment. The instructions below assume a Python-centric environment. If you prefer containerized workflows, you can adapt these steps to a Docker-based setup later.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip (Python package manager)
- Basic familiarity with the command line
- Access to the internet to fetch source data and dependencies

Installation
- Clone the repository locally
  - git clone https://github.com/swileran/v2ray-config-collector.git
- Navigate to the project directory
  - cd v2ray-config-collector
- Install dependencies
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - If you use a virtual environment, create one first: python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
- Optional: install optional extras if your sources require them
  - pip install -r requirements-extra.txt

Quick start guide
- Run the collector directly
  - python -m v2ray_config_collector
  - or, if the entry point is installed, v2ray-config-collector
- Provide a configuration file if you want to customize sources
  - The project supports a YAML or JSON config that lists sources, authentication, and test endpoints
- Watch the streaming output
  - The tool prints status messages as it fetches, normalizes, validates, and tests
- Save results to disk
  - Use the built-in option to store results as JSON or CSV. The output path is configurable in the config file

Sources and data flows
- Source types
  - Public HTTP(S) endpoints that provide lists of V2Ray configurations
  - Local files on disk, including JSON, YAML, and TOML representations
  - Cloud storage buckets via APIs (e.g., S3-compatible storage) with credentials
  - Git repositories with configuration snippets
- Data flow
  - Each source is queried in parallel
  - Raw data is parsed into a common model
  - Duplicates are filtered, and the dataset is normalized
  - Normalized configurations are validated for required fields and formats
  - Valid configurations are tested for connectivity and basic performance
  - Results are aggregated and written to output files or streams
- Handling of sensitive data
  - The collector treats credentials with care
  - Credentials are stored only where necessary and using environment-based or file-based methods
  - Logs do not leak sensitive data unless explicitly configured to do so

Processing pipeline
- Ingestion: gather raw configurations from all configured sources
- Normalization: convert various formats into a consistent internal structure
- De-duplication: filter out duplicates based on key fields
- Validation: enforce schema rules to ensure that each item is usable
- Testing: attempt a connection to a known test endpoint or to a peer, simulating real-world use
- Serialization: convert the in-memory results to JSON, CSV, or other formats
- Archiving: optionally store snapshots for audit and rollback

Validation and testing
- Validation rules
  - Required fields: protocol, address, port, and at least one of user ID, alter ID, or path as applicable
  - Protocol compatibility: ensure the configuration matches known V2Ray protocol variants
  - Address format: verify hostnames or IP addresses conform to expectations
  - Port ranges: check that port numbers are within valid ranges
- Connectivity tests
  - Test endpoints: a set of reliable test URLs or gateways to validate through-proxy connectivity
  - Latency measurement: capture basic latency during the test
  - Error handling: report timeouts, connection refusals, and authentication failures clearly
- Result categories
  - Valid and reachable: passes all checks
  - Valid but slow: passes checks but with high latency
  - Invalid: fails one or more validation tests
  - Unreachable: the test could not connect through the proxy
- Output impact
  - Each result includes a status, reason codes, and a human-friendly message
  - Output files categorize items by status for easy review

Output formats
- JSON: structured representation suitable for further processing or dashboards
- CSV: tabular view for analysis in spreadsheets or BI tools
- Human-readable tables: quick reviews in terminals or logs
- Logs: detailed line-based logs for auditing and debugging
- Artifacts: optional compressed archives for batch sharing

Configuration and customization
- Source configuration
  - Each source entry includes type, location, authentication (if needed), and fetch policy
- Processing options
  - Concurrency level: number of parallel workers
  - Deduplication strategy: how duplicates are detected and removed
  - Validation strictness: how aggressive validation rules are
- Testing customization
  - Choose test endpoints
  - Set timeouts and retry policies
  - Enable or disable latency measurements
- Output customization
  - Output directory and file naming
  - Which formats to produce (JSON, CSV, logs)
  - Tagging for results to support multi-project workflows
- Environment variables
  - Use environment variables to inject sensitive values like API keys or credentials
  - The tool reads a safe subset of environment variables and masks sensitive values in logs

Concurrency and performance
- Multi-threading model
  - Fetch and test tasks run in parallel to maximize throughput
  - The number of workers is configurable to suit hardware limits
- Efficient data handling
  - Streaming parsing avoids loading massive files fully into memory
  - In-place normalization minimizes temporary copies
- Bottlenecks and mitigation
  - Network-bound steps may limit throughput; increase the worker pool where appropriate
  - CPU-bound normalization is typically light; profile and optimize if needed
- Scaling patterns
  - Run multiple instances in a distributed setup to handle higher loads
  - Use a shared storage backend for results in multi-node configurations

Security and privacy
- Data handling
  - Respect source privacy; do not store credentials unless necessary
  - Clean up sensitive fields from in-memory objects after processing
- Access control
  - Restrict access to results and logs using file permissions or container isolation
- Secrets management
  - Use environment-based credentials or secret managers when possible
  - Do not hardcode credentials in configuration files

Observability and logging
- Structured logs
  - Each step logs key attributes: source, item identifier, status, and duration
- Log levels
  - INFO for normal progress, DEBUG for troubleshooting, WARN for non-fatal issues, ERROR for failures
- Metrics (optional)
  - Track number of fetched items, validation passes, and tests per source
  - Emit timing data for each stage of the pipeline
- Auditing
  - Keep snapshots of the raw and processed data for review
  - Provide a way to reproduce results from a given snapshot

Testing and quality assurance
